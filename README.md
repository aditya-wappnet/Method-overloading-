# Method-overloading-

#Brief detail of the project

Overloading in Java is the ability to create multiple methods of the same name, but with different parameters.
The main advantage of this is cleanliness of code.
There is only one file of class salary.java.
In these projects, the User wants to Know the Total salary of the Software Team, Family members, and HR Team. So we used one Method() and passed different parameters to it for the Software team we passed the developer and tester salary parameter, for the Family member son, daughter, and wife salary parameters and for the HR team We passed Manager and Accountants  salary parameter. When user asked we passed total salary of everyone using method overloading concept.
